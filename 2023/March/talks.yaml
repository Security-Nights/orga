  title: "Hashing - what's not to be confused about?"
  abstract: "In theory hashing is very simple: take an input of arbitrary length and map it to an output of fixed length, and you are done. But when security comes into play things tend to get ugly fast.
    This short talk intends to shed light on relevant use cases, describe important security considerations, and give you some pointers what to look out for in your next code review/project/bug bounty/etc."
