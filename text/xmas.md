# new year wishes

Hey everyone, we from the security night orgra like to have a small chat with you.

This year a lot of change occurred, and we like to talk about it. We all have left a difficult year
 to passed behind, one that left very little time to spare to organize another security night.

While we missed our goal to arrange a night for December, we are confidence, that we managed to get
something organized again!

With this, we wish everyone a merry Christmas and a  nice transition into the new year â€“ may 2023 be
full of new opportunities! Enjoy yourselves and take care.

Happy new year! 

Kind regards,
Martin, Hendrik and Akendo
