# new year wishes

What a year!

2022 has certainly been another year to remember (for better or for worse) - lots of changes, uncertainty, and lessons learned.

And it wasn't just the world at large that saw some changes - our Security Nights team had its fair share of shake-ups too.
We are still working to establish new routines with the new setup and strive to get back to a more regular schedule for 2023 (pinky promise!).

Let's hope that 2023 is a little bit less... eventful (or at least, less eventful in the bad way). 
With that said we wish you and your families a happy and healthy holiday season, and a great start for 2023. 
May your cybers be secure and your luck plentyful :-)

All the best!
