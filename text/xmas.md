Hey everyone, it's akendo, you may or may not know me, but I'm with the organization team. 

Let's have a small chat. Because in this year a lot of change occurred, and we like to talk about
it.  We all have left a difficult year to passed behind, one that left very little time to spare to
organize another security night. 

Foremost, much happened within the organization team. Michael has withdrawn because of his situation
in life. He might not be gone for good, but unavailable most of the time. This means we lost a good
deal of manpower, helping to coping with getting things done. 

While we missed our goal to arrange a night for December, we are confidence, that we managed to get
something organized again!
